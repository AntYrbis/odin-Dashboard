# odin-Dashboard

A Dashboard page (using HTML, CSS(grid and media queries) and JS (only front)) made during the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course on the Odin Project, this page is not responsive.
I took this opportunity to learn more about CSS and see more about CSS grids mixed with flex. But also to play with more colors, and try to make them still look good and be comfortable to read.
